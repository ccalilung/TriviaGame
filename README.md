# TriviaGame

Instructions: This is a game of trivia. Once you click "Start Game," you will be asked a series of 15 questions in a random order. You will have 10 seconds to answer the question, before the question is marked incorrect, timer resets, and a new question appears. Once you start, the timer cannot be stopped until you have cycled through all 15 questions.
