Background: This game was developed using JavaScript and JQuery. The challenge was to develop a game that allowed the user a certain amount of time to consider a question and its answers. If the person answered correctly, that would be recorded on the browser and the player could continue; if incorrectly answered or time runs out, that also would be recorded as an incorrect answer and the game would continue. Using JQuery and JavaScript methods, the correct answers were stored in objects with their questions, and the input from the client was compared to the object in order to determine correctness. Once that had been established, the proper field would be updated in the browser to update the score.

Instructions: This is a game of trivia. Once you click "Start Game," you will be asked a series of 15 questions in a random order. You will have 10 seconds to answer the question before the question is marked incorrect. After you answer, you will be shown the correct answer and the timer will reset. Once you start, the timer cannot be stopped until you have cycled through all 15 questions.
